# deskBookingApp

Mobile application for NeWork, a personal project of an app for companies to handle their office after Covid

The app should be fully functional as so, and can therefore be ran on your computer using Expo as a way to run it on your smartphone for example

App starts with a nice animation before landing on a logging page (contact me @asirgue.nework@gmail.com to create an account as signup page has not been implemented yet)
You can then book a desk with specific criterias and date, consult your past bookings, and see your profile as an employee of a client company may want to do.

This app has not pe published to the App Store as the project has not been launched.
